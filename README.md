# Eliki

* Eliki is a personal wiki in Electron.

# Security Warnings

* This is a hobby project and *not safe against malicious inputs*.
* Simply inserting `<script>` blocks into your wiki isn't enough to get them to run, however.
* An actual hack would be `<img src="whatever.gif" onerror="alert('hi');" />`

# Wiki Notes

* Internal wikilinks are formatted [[like so]].
* Page titles are not case-sensitive and purge most non-alphanumeric ASCII characters.
* Everything you write will be interpreted as Markdown.
* External links are opened in your main web browser.
